    //CONSTRUCTOR
    //1 constructor with 2 String parameters. Each parameter represents a coordinate. 
    //For example, "(1,2)" and "(3,4)" would be two parameter values 
    //You will have to parse the string into 4 integers, representing the 2 points.

        y1 = Integer.parseInt(point1.substring(breakPt1 + 1, point1.length() - 1)); // Finds the y value in the coordinate and turns it from a String to a number using parseInt
